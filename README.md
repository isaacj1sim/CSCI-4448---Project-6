**OOAD Project Title: Project 6 - Stratego**  <br />
**Team Members: Jason Nguyen, Varunjit Srinivas, Isaac Sim** <br />

**Software Used:** <br />
**IntelliJ Community: ver. 2021.1.2** <br />
**JUnit ver 5.7.2** <br />

**Overview:** <br />
- We have set up a basic demonstration of what we plan on accomplishing next week.
- We followed Varunjit's plan from last week and have a good idea of where to go next.
- There are some blank files that we have planned to work on but are contemplating on whether to include in the final project or not, such as the bot class. 

**Issues Experienced:** <br />
- Jason started his own code for the game in the middle of the night not knowing that Isaac had also been working on his own code. Isaac was further along so Jason accepted his work as the codebase. 
- Reading another person’s code and figuring out their design isn’t always easy. We pushed for more delegation & modularity of code for future ease of expandability and readability.
- The path that development took deviated a little from the original class diagram design plan that Varunjit had planned.

**Conslusion:** <br />
- Overall a good start to the Final project to this class, however we have a lot of room to improve. 
- We did a good job but should communicate more, especially more in detail.
- This is a great way to apply the various patterns we learned in class thus far.

**OOAD Project Title: Project 7 - Stratego** <br />
**Team Members: Jason Nguyen, Varunjit Srinivas, Isaac Sim** <br />

**Software Used:** <br />
**IntelliJ Community: ver. 2021.1.2** <br />
**JavaFX**  <br />
**JUnit ver 5.7.2** <br />

**Required Setup:** <br />
- Download JavaFX JDK & extract at - https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/
- Add JavaFX JDK library path to IntelliJ library.
- Add this path to VM Options in IntelliJ (replace default path with your path of javafx lib): --module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk-15.0.1/lib --add-modules -javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
- Game code works best on Java 11 JDK Compiler


**Overview:** <br />
- Developed functional front end GUI using JavaFX
- Integrated together Game code and GUI
- Final version of our Stratego Game project is released. 

**Issues Expierienced:** <br />
- Time Constraint for the project - A lot of work to do in so little time during Summer Schedule
- Coordinating between team members was difficult because each of our schedules were entirely different (mostly incompatible)
- Had to learn entirely new language with JavaFX to be able to implement a window based GUI (very difficult, lots of debugging)

**Conclusion:** <br />
- The project was very tedious and workload intensive, especially on such a short time crunch. 
- Learning JavaFX for the GUI implementation also had a huge learning curve that often caused a lot of headaches trying to debug code.
- Despite this, value skills were developed on implementing OO Design Patterns into a ground up project.
