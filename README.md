**OOAD Project Title: Project 6 - Stratego
Team Members: Jason Nguyen, Varunjit Srinivas, Issac Sim**

**Software Used:
IntelliJ Community: ver. 2021.1.2
JUnit ver 5.7.2**

**Overview:**
- We have set up a basic demonstration of what we plan on accomplishing next week.
- We followed Varunjit's plan from last week and have a good idea of where to go next.
- There are some blank files that we have planned to work on but are contemplating on whether to include in the final project or not, such as the bot class. 

**Issuues Expierienced:**
- Jason started his own code for the game in the middle of the night not knowing that Isaac had also been working on his own code. Isaac was further along so Jason accepted his work as the codebase. 
- Reading another person’s code and figuring out their design isn’t always easy. We pushed for more delegation & modularity of code for future ease of expandability and readability.
- The path that development took deviated a little from the original class diagram design plan that Varunjit had planned.

**Conslusion:**
- Overall a good start to the Final project to this class, however we have a lot of room to improve. 
- We did a good job but should communicate more, especially more in detail.
- This is a great way to apply the various patterns we learned in class thus far.
